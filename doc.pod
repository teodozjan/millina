=head1 Simulation

Model is very important. It must be as detailed as possible but not more...

In this model I will borrow a litle from HLA IEEE 1516 but not RTI. 

The simulation will be made of objects that will affect each other via interactions just like High Level Architecture does.
Areas that were optional in HLA here will be base feature.

=head2 Area

Position of object is not important for simulation but area that object come interaction with. Area is the maximum range that any objects may recieve or want to interact HLA simulation designers already knew that and introduced that as part of standard.

=head3 Rectangle

It was easy to use rectangle for simulation. It can be defined by only four numbers and it is trivial to define its overlaping. 

Planes overlap each other if at least one of vertex is above lower vertex of second plane and below upper vertex corners. 

     for $rect1.toVertex -> $vertex {
       $rect2.x[0] <= $vertex.x >= $rect.x[1];
       $rect2.y[0] <= $vertex.y >= $rect.y[1];
     }

=head2 Interaction

Interaction has area of... bnana bnana
